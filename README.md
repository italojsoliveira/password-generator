# Password Generator

A simple password generator web app created with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and deployed on [Render](https://render.com/)[^1].

**Website:** https://password-generator-1tkv.onrender.com

To run the app locally, install the required Python libraries and run `password_generator.py` via the Streamlit command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
streamlit run password_generator.py
```

[^1]: The app may take a while to load on Render because it is hosted under a free plan.
